# What is BDS?

- **BDS** = Basic Data Structure
- A flexible ADaM format used for most subject-level analysis datasets
- Key features:
  - One record per subject, parameter, and timepoint
  - Standardized variables: `PARAMCD`, `AVAL`, `ADY`, `TRTP`, etc.
  - Derived from SDTM + ADSL

# BDS Subtypes

BDS is used for different analysis goals:

::: nonincremental
| Subtype          | Purpose                            | Examples         |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| Findings         | Repeated measurements               | ADVS, ADLB, ADPC |
| Exposure         | Treatment summaries                 | ADEX             |
| Time-to-Event    | Event durations and censoring       | ADTTE            |
| Response         | Categorical clinical outcomes        | ADRS             |
| PK Parameters    | Derived pharmacokinetic values      | ADPPK            |
:::

All share the same core structure, adapted for their purpose.

# Common BDS Datasets

## ADPC – PK Concentrations

- Based on SDTM PC domain
- Measures drug levels in biofluids (e.g. plasma)
- Used in non-compartmental PK analysis

## ADPPK – PK Parameters

- Based on ADPC results
- Derived AUC, Cmax, Tmax, etc.
- Used for dose-response modeling

## ADRS – Response Data

- Derived from RS, TU, TR domains
- Categorical outcomes: CR, PR, SD, PD
- Often used in oncology

## ADTTE – Time to Event

- Based on ADSL and AE/DS/VS events
- Used for endpoints like OS, PFS, time to death
- Key variables: `AVAL`, `CNSR`, `STARTDT`, `ADT`

## ADVS – Vital Signs

- Based on SDTM VS
- Derives BMI, MAP, etc.
- Used in safety summaries

# Variable Types in BDS

We group derived variables by **purpose**:

- Timing
- Parameter Identification
- Results

---

## Derived Parameters & Reference Ranges

These variables are used to derive secondary parameters like BMI, or classify results based on reference ranges.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BMI`, `MAP`, etc. | Derived from base measurements |
| `ANRLO`, `ANRHI` | Normal limits |
| `ANRIND` | Low/High/Normal flag |
| `BNRIND` | Baseline version of ANRIND |
:::

---

## Baseline & Change, Flags & Filtering

Variables in this group allow for baseline comparisons and identifying relevant records for analysis.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `BASE` | Baseline value |
| `CHG` | Change from baseline |
| `PCHG` | Percent change |
| `ABLFL` | Baseline flag |
| `BASETYPE` | Type of baseline measurement |
| `ANL01FL` | Primary analysis record flag |
| `ASEQ` | Sequence number |
:::

---

## Treatment Assignment, Categorization & Criteria

These variables classify treatment types and apply clinical thresholds to categorize observations.

::: nonincremental
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `TRTA` | Actual treatment |
| `TRTP` | Planned treatment |
| `AVALCATy` | Categorized values |
| `CRITy`, `CRITyFL`, `CRITyFN` | Threshold logic (e.g., BP > 180) |
:::

---

## ADSL Merge & New Rows

Derived BDS datasets also pull in subject-level attributes from ADSL, and may create new rows summarizing or imputing data.

- Add subject-level variables from ADSL (e.g. `AGE`, `SEX`, `TRTSDT`)
- Derive new records (e.g. summary rows, worst value, average across visits)

# Hands-On Workshop: BDS – Findings

We will derive a BDS Findings dataset using `{admiral}`.

Link: [https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_finding.html](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_finding.html)

Key steps:
- Read SDTM data
- Derive `ADT`, `ADY`
- Assign `PARAMCD`, `PARAM`
- Derive `AVAL`, `BASE`, `CHG`, `ANL01FL`, etc.
- Merge with ADSL
- Add labels and attributes

Repository: [GitHub Code](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/blob/main/vignettes/bds_finding.Rmd)

# Other BDS Types Work Similarly

Once you master Findings-type BDS, the rest follow similar logic:

- TTE: uses `CNSR`, event definitions
- Exposure: aggregates dose/duration from EX

Further examples:
- [Time-to-Event BDS (ADTTE)](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/articles/bds_tte.html)
- [Exposure BDS](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/bds_exposure.html)
